# Yugioh Card Analysis

Okay, this little project is made by myself for fun. It has two aims:

(1) Use selenium to scrape all the yugioh cards from TCG website

(2) Do a simple analysis of yugioh card collection, because I want to collect this card, but I do want to know my cost.

This is an introductory analysis which is suitable for beginner. There are a lot lot of other stuffs which could be added or expanded. So I put the data set I have here. If anyone who is interested in analyzing something else,
just do it, and let me know your creative ideas. 

And this dataset can also be a small database to check, categorize, review and other operations. Maybe you can use it to check something.

Most important stuff is to have fun, I know the people who click this link is the Yugioh lovers, hope we can have fun from it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
