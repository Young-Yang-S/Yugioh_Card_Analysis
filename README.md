# Yugioh Card Analysis

Okay, this little project is made by myself for fun. It has two aims:

(1) Use selenium to scrape all the yugioh cards from TCG website

(2) Do a simple analysis of yugioh card collection, because I want to collect this card, but I do want to know my cost.

This is an introductory analysis which is suitable for beginner. There are a lot lot of other stuffs which could be added or expanded. So I put the data set I have here. If anyone who is interested in analyzing something else,
just do it, and let me know your creative ideas. 

And this dataset can also be a small database to check, categorize, review and other operations. Maybe you can use it to check something.

Most important stuff is to have fun, I know the people who click this link is the Yugioh lovers, hope we can have fun from it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Note: There are some drawbacks of this project

(1) The rarity column only get one word to show the rarity of card which may be ambiguous

(2) Some cards names which should be the same cards but have different names, like if there is a card name ninja, then it has other name ninja (purple) which could have some bad effects towards the analysis.

(3) Some cards have same name but different forms, like blue eyes white dragon, this part is also ignored.
